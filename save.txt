I am Harry Huang (aka Wenyuan Huang, 黄问远), a junior standing student of Math & CS at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.
                    Currently, my primary areas of study include (Deep) Reinforcement Learning, Algorithm Optimization, and Computational Complexity.
                    Recently, I have been reading literature on semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning.
                    At the same time, I am also deeply interested in Probability Theory and Game Theory.
                <br />
                    I am an active algorithm competition participant, having won national first prizes every year during my three years of high school, and I won the champion of the ICPC NCNA on November 9, 2024.
                <br /> Outside of academics, I excel in swimming, badminton and instrument playing.
                    I started learning piano at the age of four and began teaching myself the cello after entering university, participating in a symphony/string orchestra for two and a half consecutive years.
